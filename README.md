# CS431-HW4

Normalization and Implementation

This is a continuation of the group project. The goals of this assignment are:

* Make sure every student can write a query with a join
* Give you practice with normalization

1. **For your ER model from hw3, each student should:**
* take a different subset of the attributes by choosing 2 (or more) connected entities and taking all attributes from those entities. There * will probably be some overlap. That's fine.
* define all functional dependencies that exist in this group of attributes
* show the result of applying 3rd Normal Form normalization for these attributes.
* This part is plain text. A regular text file will be fine -- if you really want to use a word processor for the arrows or something, please export to a PDF so I can read the result.
2. **Implement your model. If there is anything different between the ER model and what normalization suggests, explain the choice you made.**
* This part is code and should only be plaintext .sql files
* Follow the example of hw1 and have separate create/insert/query files. Document the order in which to execute the create/insert files.
* Insert data to demonstrate that the queries work
* The queries should cover the questions you listed in hw3. Every member should get at least one query that requires a join.
* Continue to use comments to explain the queries (like which question from hw3 a query is supposed to answer) and as necessary, connecting the SQL to the model. Include comments to indicate how your data shows the query is correct (example: "The platypus is included as an example of a mammal that also lays eggs")
 

Submitting: you can zip things up or pass along the github link (or just say you're using the same repository as for hw3)
